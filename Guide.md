- Numbers can also be used as strings `print('5')`

#### Comments

- Can be used to explain code
- Use `#` symbol to start a comment which will be ignored by python

#### Variables

- Used to assign and store values
- Can be used to store different data types

#### Conditional Logic

- Used to do perform tasks based on certain conditions
